Studies have shown that older adults use of social networks and online communication can increase social support, improve quality of life and increase their health. The purpose of this study was to understand the older adult''s experiences of online Social Interactions. Materials and Methods: This study was performed following a qualitative approach and phenomenological methodology in Semnan (Iran) in 2016. The studied sample was taken by purposive sampling method. Required data was collected via deep and semi-structured interviews with 9 older adults who were active members of at least one online social network. The obtained data was analyzed using the seven-step Colaizzi''s method. Results: From data analysis, the main theme of \"developed social interactions\" was extracted from five sub-themes: \"interaction with family and friends\", \"revival of old relationships\", \"familiar with people with common interests\", \"impalpable control\" and \"liberation from loneliness\". Conclusion: The results explained the various dimensions of the use of the older adults from online social networks and showed that these networks have the potential to be used to enhance social interactions in aging. The results of this study can help planners by identifying the benefits of these networks, while taking necessary interventions to increase the use of the elderly from these networks, promote social interactions and, consequently, promote the health of the elderly. © 2018, Semnan University of Medical Sciences.

High levels of technophobia (fear of modern technologies or discomfort with them), however, may constrain older Internet users’ online activity and limit the benefits they derive therefrom. The literature on technophobia in later life tends to focus on nonusers and ignore older individuals who already use advanced technologies. Relying on an online survey of 537 Internet users aged 60 and up, this study explored the extent to which technophobia constrains older users’ online activity. The results demonstrated varying levels of technophobia among users and significant associations between technophobia and Internet use patterns, including type and complexity of use. Technophobia also correlated with users’ education, perceived health and well-being: Technophobes tended to be less satisfied with their lives—a correlation that remained significant even after controlling for background variables and online activities. The findings suggest that technophobia plays a role at both the first and second levels of the digital divide among seniors. They also indicate that technophobia may be a risk factor in later life, suggesting that older users ought to be taken into account in planning measures to reduce technophobia among seniors. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","Document Type":"Article","Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85040988674","abstract_structured":"0","filter_OA_include":"1","filter_study_include":"0","notes":""}');

One service that addresses both these imperatives is home visiting services. Home visiting services connect home visitors with isolated older people. To examine how older people navigate volunteering for a home visiting service, six visitors were interviewed and the interviews were analysed using discourse analysis. A professionalism discourse was used to construct home visiting as a structured social support service that improved the lives of isolated older people. A personal relationship discourse constructed home visiting as an opportunity to forge long-term relationships that benefit both parties. At times these two discourses created tension for home visitors. Examining how the home visiting service is described by the service organisation online explains these tensions. The online materials construct active older volunteers as providing professional services while those they visit are constructed as receiving friendship. These discourses provide different ageing identities for visitors from those they visit, which contributes to the difficulties in navigating home visiting services. Addressing these tensions will enable service co-ordinators to better meet the needs of both visitors and clients in the context of increasing need for such services. © Cambridge University Press 2016.","Document Type":"Article","Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85007416081","abstract_structured":"0","filter_OA_include":"1","filter_study_include":"0","notes":""}');

The study sample included n = 1995 community dwelling older people aged between 65 and 74 years from the baseline of the longitudinal International Mobility in Aging Study (IMIAS). In order to measure social networks for each type of social tie, participants were asked about the number of contacts, the number of contacts they see at least once a month or have a very good relationship with, or speak with at least once a month. For social support, participants had to rate the level of social support provided by the four types of contacts for five Likert scale items. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was conducted to determine the goodness of fit of the measurement models. Satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices confirmed the satisfactory factorial structure of the IMIAS-SNSS instrument. Reliability coefficients were 0.80, 0.81, 0.85, and 0.88 for friends, children, family, and partner models, respectively. The models were confirmed by CFA for each type of social tie. Moreover, IMIAS-SNSS detected gender differences in the older adult populations of IMIAS. These results provide evidence supporting that IMIAS-SNSS is a psychometrically sound instrument and of its validity and reliability for international populations of older adults. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Document Type":"Article","Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85042200580","abstract_structured":"0","filter_OA_include":"1","filter_study_include":"0","notes":""}');

Past evidence shows that family victimization may play an essential role in the way adolescents learn cyberbullying behaviors. Yet, research on the co-occurrence of family victimization and cyberbullying is limited. This study aims to investigate the associations between cyberbullying and family victimization among adolescents, and to examine the health correlates of cyberbullying and family poly-victimization. A large sample of 18,341 students, aged 15–17, from six cities in China, collected between 2009 and 2010 is employed in the present study, which investigated the association between various kinds of family victimization and adolescent cyberbullying. Data analysis was conducted in 2017. In-law conflict, intimate partner violence, elder abuse and neglect, and child maltreatment were associated with a higher possibility of children becoming internet victims. Parents’ divorce and separation, low family income, mother''s low level of education, and father''s unemployment were all associated with cyberbullying victimization. Cyber victimization was positively correlated to symptoms of PTSD and depression, self-harm, and other physical and mental health variables. Possible explanations for the relationships found in this study are discussed and implications for future research and services are provided. Proactive screening for family poly-victimization and cyberbullying is suggested. Schools are highly recommended to cooperate with parents to promote cyber safety. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Document Type":"Article","Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85041579104","abstract_structured":"0","filter_OA_include":"0","filter_study_include":"0","notes":""}');

Contact with new technology is a problem for many older adults. Objective: The goal of the present study was to examine how family members support older adults in the acquisition and usage of ICT. Methods: In the qualitative preliminary study, structured interviews with older adults (n = 5) and their family members (n = 6) were performed, which included questions on technology biography, technology acquisition and the effect of the technology usage on the social network. The results were part of the questionnaire of the main study. The main study was part of an accompanying intervention study. A total of 46 adults older than 60 years were included. In addition to aspects from the preliminary study, questions to sex-specific differences regarding the technical support of the social network were also analyzed. Results: Data analysis revealed that mainly family members purchase ICT for the older adults, and they are the main contact persons for technical problems. Above all, the seniors asked their own children for advice. Moreover, seniors who had increased technology use in everyday life (95.7%, n = 22) and higher technology acceptance (mean = 44.0, standard deviation = 7.4) had already had previous experience with technology during school age/career. Conclusion: In the households of older adults, fewer new ICT are found. The interest to purchase ICT is triggered by the technology support of family members. If the technical assistance was distributed to several members of the family and other networks, the burden of an individual family member could be reduced. In addition, the influence of different participants could increase the technology usage of older adults. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland.","Document Type":"Article","Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85028333916","abstract_structured":"1","filter_OA_include":"1","filter_study_include":"0","notes":"focus on elderly"}');

Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

However, whether Internet use increases or decreases social networks, loneliness, and quality of life is not clear-cut. Purposes: To explore the direct and/or indirect effects of Internet use on QoL, and to examine whether ethnicity and time the elderly spent with family moderate the mediation effect of Internet use on quality of life throughout loneliness. Methods: This descriptive-correlational study was carried out in 2016 by structured interviews with a convenience sample of 502 respondents aged 50 and older, living in northern Israel. Bootstrapping with resampling strategies was used for testing mediation a model. Results: Use of the Internet was found to be positively associated with QoL. However, this relationship was mediated by loneliness, and moderated by the time the elderly spent with family members. In addition, respondents’ ethnicity significantly moderated the mediation effect between Internet use and loneliness. Conclusions: Internet use can enhance QoL of older adults directly or indirectly by reducing loneliness. However, these effects are conditional on other variables.

In particular, among older adults, a considerably large group of individuals has been identified as not using the Internet by themselves; rather, they ask members of their personal networks to do things online for them—they “use” the Internet by proxy. Since previous research shows that children and grandchildren are important sources of help when it comes to Internet use, the current paper indicates that the notion of intergenerational solidarity is a sound conceptual basis for understanding the relationship between social support networks and proxy Internet use among Internet non-users. Notably, the concept of functional solidarity as a dimension of intergenerational solidarity is advanced, as this relates to the frequency of the intergenerational exchange of resources and services encompassing various types of assistance and support offered between two generations. Empirically, this paper investigates how the two types of social support networks and their characteristics are associated with proxy Internet use. The results from multivariate analyses of survey data from a nation-wide representative sample show that when comparing emotional support and socializing networks, only the latter is associated with proxy Internet use: Internet non-users who have (grand-)children in their socializing support network are more likely to engage in proxy Internet use. The results also indicate that non-users who are younger, more educated, have children, and live in urban areas are more inclined to engage in proxy Internet use, regardless of the type of social support. The findings indicate the importance of empirical investigation related to different aspects of functional solidarity, as the effects on proxy Internet use depend on the type of social support. © 2017","Document Type":"Article","Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85042285324","abstract_structured":"0","filter_OA_include":"0","filter_study_include":"0","notes":"broader"}');

When their primary function, to inform, has been rendered obsolete, we are faced with the question why people continue to display these objects, often next to newer models, in their living rooms. The main argument is that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) commodities, old and new, defective and repaired, are primarily social objects that are embedded in complex webs of practices and expectations which unsettle the taken-for-granted associations between technology and time.

While risk factors for problem drinking in late life have been identified, it remains unknown whether these factors drive daily drinking among older problem drinkers. This study examined the daily drivers of drinking among problem drinkers, moderated by age, utilizing ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Method: Participants (N = 139), ages 20–73, received daily EMA online surveys completed via a smartphone prior to initiation of treatment. Multilevel modeling tested the moderating impact of age on within- and between-person relationships between drinking and focal predictors (mood, loneliness, boredom, stress, poor sleep, social factors, alcohol salience, commitment and confidence not to drink heavily). Results: Older adults reported greater alcohol consumption when daily boredom levels were higher. Heavier drinking among younger adults was associated with poorer sleep quality. Greater daily confidence, daily commitment and daily alcohol salience did not impact drinking to the same extent for older adults as for younger adults. Greater person-level commitment predicted reduced drinking equivalently across age, but low person-level commitment predicted greater drinking among older adults compared to their younger counterparts. Conclusion: Older adults may have unique daily drivers of drinking that are not fully realized in current research and intervention efforts. Addressing the growing substance-use treatment needs among this population will require identifying the unique drivers of drinking among older adults, such as boredom, when compared to younger adults. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Document Type":"Article","Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85044390759","abstract_structured":"1","filter_OA_include":"0","filter_study_include":"0","notes":""}');

ROBIN is integrated in a sensor-rich environment that aims to continuously monitor physical and psychological wellbeing of older persons living alone. The caregivers (formal/informal) can communicate through it with their assisted persons. Long-term trials in real houses highlighted several user requirements that inspired improvements on the robotic platform. The enhanced telepresence robot was assessed by users to test its suitability to support social interaction and provide motivational feedback on health-related aspects. Methods: Twenty-five users (n = 25) assessed the new multimodal interaction capabilities and new communication services. A psychophysiological approach was adopted to investigate aspects like engagement, usability, and affective impact, as well as the possible role of individual differences on the quality of human-robot interaction. Results: ROBIN was overall judged usable, the interaction with/through it resulted pleasant and the required workload was limited, thus supporting the idea of using it as a central component for remote assistance and social participation. Open-minded users tended to have a more positive interaction with it. Conclusions: This work describes an enabling technology for remote assistance and social communication. It highlights the importance of being compliant with users'' needs to develop solutions easy to use and able to foster their social connections. The role of personality appeared to be relevant for the interaction, underscoring a clear role of the service personalization. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.","Document Type":"Article","Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85041746549","abstract_structured":"1","filter_OA_include":"maybe","filter_study_include":"0","notes":""}');

In this study, we aimed at (a) developing a measurement instrument assessing the factors of older adults'' perceptions of their environment, (b) examining the associations of these environmental factors with quality of life domains physical health, psychological, social relations, and environmental, controlling for background characteristics. Design and Methods: Associations between environmental factors and quality of life domains were examined in a crosssectional study using a sample of 1,031 Dutch people aged 65 years and older. Participants completed a Web-based questionnaire, the \"Senioren Barometer.\" Forty-two questions on environmental factors were asked, and quality of life domains were assessed by the WHOQOL-BREF. Results: Seven scales (comprising 3-9 items) of environment were constructed-housing, facilities, nuisance, residents, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic. All quality of life domains (physical, psychological, social, environmental) were associated with at least one environmental scale. Housing, residents, and nuisance were associated with 4, 3, and 2 domains, respectively. Facilities, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic were associated only with quality of life environmental. Implications: This study showed that multiple environmental factors are associated with quality of life in older people. To support independent living in older people health and social care professionals and policymakers may need to carry out interventions, in particular focusing on housing, residents, and nuisance. © 2017 The Author(s).

However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups.

Using a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (N = 2,003), this study focuses on Facebook users (N = 1,138) and examines patterns of Facebook use by younger (aged 18–65 years) and older users (aged 65 or older), as well as the social benefits associated with older users’ Facebook use. Findings show that older users have different network structures, but the frequency of their visits and engagement in Social Media Relationship Maintenance Behaviors (SMRMB), a measure of perceived likelihood to engage with others via social media, do not significantly differ from those of younger users. Moreover, our results suggest that among older users (N = 98), the number of self-reported “actual” friends on Facebook and SMRMB positively predict perceived support, while SMRMB contributes to perceptions of access to useful information.

It affects people of all ages but particularly elderly who struggle to maintain social ties into later-life. Interventions in social isolation primarily focus on elderly in clinical care, overlooking the existence of older adults who live independently. Despite facing dwindling social contact, groups of healthy older adults reside alongside large groups of younger citizens that might offer much needed social interaction. This type of intergenerational social interaction seems promising but motivations of elderly to engage with younger groups who are not necessarily related to them are not well-understood and vice-versa. Persuasive games have the potential to encouraging social interaction. This paper presents a preliminary work on investigating motivations for intergenerational interaction rooted in persuasion theory. It proposes the use of the Integrated Behavior Model as a theoretical framework for understanding behavioral determinants and explores the use of games as a way of fostering changes in attitudes that could enhance intergenerational interactions. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2018.","Document Type":"Conference Paper","Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85043278214","abstract_structured":"0","filter_OA_include":"maybe","filter_study_include":"0","notes":""}');

The social media advertising campaign focused on enrollment for a Phase 1 clinical trial. Traditional means of recruiting-billboards, newspaper advertising, word of mouth, personal referrals, and direct mail-were not producing enough qualified participants. Objective: To demonstrate the effectiveness of using targeted advertising on the social networking site Facebook to recruit people aged 60 years and older for volunteer clinical trial participation. Methods: The trial sponsor used a proactive approach to recruit participants using advertising on social media. The sponsor placed and monitored an Institutional Review Board-Approved advertising campaign on Facebook to recruit potential candidates for a Phase 1 clinical trial. The clinical trial required a 10-day residential (overnight) stay at a clinic in Michigan, with one follow-up visit. The sponsor of the clinical trial placed the advertising, which directed interested respondents to a trial-specific landing page controlled by the Contract Research Organization (CRO). The CRO provided all follow-up consenting, prescreening, screening, and enrollment procedures. The campaign was waged over an 8-week period to supplement recruiting by the CRO. Results: A total of 621 people responded to a Facebook advertising campaign by completing an online form or telephoning the CRO, and the clinical trial was fully enrolled at 45 subjects following an 8-week Facebook advertising campaign. Conclusions: An 8-week Facebook advertising campaign contributed to 868 inquiries made regarding a Phase 1 clinical trial seeking to enroll healthy elderly subjects. Over the initial 11 weeks of recruitment, 178 inquiries were received using traditional methods of outreach. Respondents to the Facebook advertising campaign described in this report engaged with the sponsored advertising at a higher rate than is typical for social media-based clinical trial recruitment strategies. The older adults'' engagement rate of 4.92% was more than twice as high as click-Through rates of younger adults engaged with social media advertising in other clinical trial recruitment studies. Advertising placed on the social media platform Facebook is effective with the healthy volunteer population aged 60 years and older. This approach can quickly and cost-effectively reach qualified candidates for clinical trial recruitment as a supplement to traditional means of recruiting.

Fear of falling might reduce physical activities resulting in declining social interactions and eventually causing depression. To lessen the effects of a fall, timely delivery of medical treatment can play a vital role. In a similar scenario, an IoT-based wearable system can pave the most promising way to mitigate serious consequences of a fall while providing the convenience of usage. However, to deliver sufficient degree of monitoring and reliability, wearable devices working at the core of fall detection systems are required to work for a prolonged period of time. In this work, we focus on energy efficiency of a wearable sensor node in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based fall detection system. We propose the design of a tiny, lightweight, flexible and energy efficient wearable device. We investigate different parameters (e.g. sampling rate, communication bus interface, transmission protocol, and transmission rate) impacting on energy consumption of the wearable device. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption of the wearable in different configurations and operating conditions. Furthermore, we provide hints (hardware and software) for system designers implementing the optimal wearable device for IoT-based fall detection systems in terms of energy efficiency and high quality of service. The results clearly indicate that the proposed sensor node is novel and energy efficient. In a critical condition, the wearable device can be used continuously for 76 h with a 1000 mAh li-ion battery. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Document Type":"Article","Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85032812646","abstract_structured":"0","filter_OA_include":"0","filter_study_include":"0","notes":""}');

During the caregiving period, socioemotional support from family and friends plays an important role in sustaining caregiving activities. Post-care, these social networks facilitate adjustment to role change and dealing with grief. Developing and improving access to peer support to enable carers to effectively cope with the challenges of caring may positively influence their caring experience. The primary objective of this project is to examine the response of isolated rural carers for older people with dementia to a videoconference (VC) based peer support and information program. Will participation in the program improve self-efficacy, quality of life, and mental health? Secondary objectives are to develop a VC based peer support program for isolated rural carers for older people with dementia, using a co-design approach; and to assess the feasibility of VC technology for enhancing social support to family caregivers in their homes. This project will collaboratively co-design and evaluate a facilitated VC peer support and information program to carers of people with dementia within rural areas. Carers will be recruited through community health and care providers. Program development will use an information sharing approach to facilitate social interaction. A focus of the project is to use off-the-shelf technology which will be more accessible than specialised bespoke solutions that are currently popular in this area of research. A mixed methods repeated measures randomized wait list design will be used to evaluate the project. The primary outcomes are self-efficacy, quality of life, and mental health. Secondary outcomes are perceived social support and user satisfaction with the technology, and intention to continue VC interaction. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

Nevertheless, it is vital to focus on the security issues and the tradeoff between privacy preserving and traceability. A novel security mechanism named as the traceable threshold attribute-based signcryption (TTABSC) can permits patients to be friends and make a proper tradeoff between privacy and traceability. The proposed scheme leverages a four-party model to prevent the leak of a patient''s sensitive information, including symptom information, identity and patient''s health information (PHI). Combining the digital signatures and encryption, we provide a series of performance analysis, including correctness, unforgeability, traceability and privacy. Compared with previous works, our most efficient scheme generates a constant signcryption size. © Copyright 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Document Type":"Article","Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85037824062","abstract_structured":"0","filter_OA_include":"0","filter_study_include":"0","notes":""}');

Face-to-face contact through video-calls may help reduce loneliness, but little is known about the processes of engaging people in care environments in using video-calls. We aimed to identify the barriers to and facilitators of implementing video-calls for older people in care environments. Methods: A collaborative action research (CAR) approach was taken to implement a video-call intervention in care environments. We undertook five steps of recruitment, planning, implementation, reflection and re-evaluation, in seven care homes and one hospital in the UK. The video-call intervention ''Skype on Wheels'' (SoW) comprised a wheeled device that could hold an iPad and handset, and used Skype to provide a free video-call service. Care staff were collaborators who implemented the intervention within the care-setting by agreeing the intervention, recruiting older people and their family, and setting up video-calls. Field notes and reflective diaries on observations and conversations with staff, older people and family were maintained over 15 months, and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Four care homes implemented the intervention. Eight older people with their respective social contacts made use of video-calls. Older people were able to use SoW with assistance from staff, and enjoyed the use of video-calls to stay better connected with family. However five barriers towards implementation included staff turnover, risk averseness, the SoW design, lack of family commitment and staff attitudes regarding technology. Conclusions: The SoW intervention, or something similar, could aid older people to stay better connected with their families in care environments, but if implemented as part of a rigorous evaluation, then co-production of the intervention at each recruitment site may be needed to overcome barriers and maximise engagement. © 2018 The Author(s).","Document Type":"Article","Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85042877274","abstract_structured":"1","filter_OA_include":"1","filter_study_include":"1","notes":""}');

A large proportion of these people will need significant help to manage various chronic illnesses, including dementia, heart disease, diabetes, limited physical movement and many others. Current approaches typically focus on acute episodes of illness and are not well designed to provide adequately for daily living care support. In our rapidly ageing society, a critical need exists for effective, affordable, scalable and safe in- home and in-residential care solutions leveraging a range of current and emerging sensor, interaction and integration technologies. Key aims are to support the ageing to live longer in their own homes; make daily challenges associated with ageing less limiting through use of technology supports; better support carers - both professional and family - in providing monitoring, proactive intervention, and community connectedness; enable in-home and in-residential care organisations to scale their support services and better use their workforces; and ultimately provide better quality of life. Deakin University researchers have been investigating a range of emerging technologies and platforms to realise this vision, which we in broad terms coin Digital Enhanced Living, in the ageing space but also supporting those with anxiety and depression, sleep disorders, various chronic diseases, recovery from injury, and various predictive analytics. A Smart Home solution, carried out in conjunction with a local start-up, has produced and trialled a novel sensor, interaction, and AI- based technology. Virtual Reality (VR) solutions have been used to support carers in the set-up of dementia-friendly homes, in conjunction with Alzheimers Australia. Activity and nutrition solutions, including the use of conversational agents, have been used to build dialogue to engage and change behaviour. Predictive analytics, in conjunction with major hospitals, have been applied to large medical datasets to better support professionals making judgements around discharge outcomes. A set of lessons have been learned from the design, deployment and trialing of these diverse solutions and new development approaches have been crafted to address the challenges faced. In particular, we found that there is a need to consider user emotional expectations as first-class citizens and create methodologies that consider the user needs during the creation of the software solutions. We find that quality and emotional aspects have to be engineered into the solution, rather than added after a technical solution is deployed. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.
